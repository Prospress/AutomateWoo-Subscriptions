# AutomateWoo Subscriptions

Advanced actions for automating a subscription's lifecycle with AutomateWoo.

With these actions, it's possible to change a subscription's:

* billing schedule, like switching it from being billed annually to monthly
* shipping, tax and fee line items

All of which can be run on any [subscription trigger](https://automatewoo.com/docs/triggers/list/#subscriptions).

Combined with the built-in actions to add, update or remove product line items, these actions make it possible to offer customers dynamic subscription lifecycles, like:

* magazines which ship monthly but are billed annual
* pre-paid subscriptions, where a customer can choose to pay

Want more subscription actions?

In future, we may add actions to:

* change a subscription's dates, like the next payment or expiration date
* process a renewal for an active subscription
* regenerate downloadable product permissions based on the subscription's current product line items

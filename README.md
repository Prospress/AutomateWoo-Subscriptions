# AutomateWoo Subscriptions

Advanced actions for automating a subscription's lifecycle with AutomateWoo.

A subscription has a number of core parts:

* product line items
* coupon line items
* shipping line items
* tax line items
* fee line items
* billing schedule, e.g. monthly or annually
* dates, like next payment date, end date or start date

The AutomateWoo plugin makes it possible to modify the first two of these with the [Add/Remove Product](https://automatewoo.com/docs/actions/subscription-add-remove-product/) and [Add/Remove Coupon](https://automatewoo.com/docs/actions/subscription-add-remove-coupon/) actions.

The **AutomateWoo Subscriptions Add-on** makes it possible to modify some of the others parts by providing additional actions.

With these actions, it's possible to change a subscription's:

* billing schedule, for example, to switch a subscription from being billed annually to monthly
* shipping costs, for example, to only charge shipping annually, despite renewing monthly

All of which can be run on any [subscription trigger](https://automatewoo.com/docs/triggers/list/#subscriptions).

Combined with the built-in actions to add, update or remove product line items, these actions make it possible to offer customers dynamic subscription lifecycles, like:

* magazines which ship monthly but are billed annually or quarterly
* pre-paid subscriptions, where a customer can choose to pay for a given period up-front
* sequential subscriptions, where a customer receives different items, at different costs, based on the date of their sign-up
* seasonal subscriptions, where a customer receives different items, at different costs, at different times of year

Want more subscription actions?

In future, we may add actions to:

* change a subscription's dates, like the next payment or expiration date
* process a renewal for an active subscription
* regenerate downloadable product permissions based on the subscription's current product line items
